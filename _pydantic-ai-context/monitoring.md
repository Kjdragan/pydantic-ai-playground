# PydanticAI Debugging and Monitoring

## Challenges in LLM Applications

LLM applications face unique challenges:
- Slow, unreliable, and expensive operations
- Non-deterministic behavior
- Sensitivity to prompt changes
- Limited debugging capabilities

As noted in the documentation: "From a software engineers point of view, you can think of LLMs as the worst database you've ever heard of, but worse. If LLMs weren't so bloody useful, we'd never touch them."

## Pydantic Logfire

Pydantic Logfire is an observability platform developed by the Pydantic team that provides comprehensive monitoring for:
- Gen AI operations
- Classic predictive AI
- HTTP traffic
- Database queries
- Other application components

### Integration

PydanticAI has built-in support for Logfire via the logfire-api no-op package:
- Zero overhead when Logfire is not installed
- Detailed run information when enabled
- Optional but powerful integration

### Setup

1. Installation:
```bash
# Using pip
pip install 'pydantic-ai[logfire]'

# Using uv
uv add 'pydantic-ai[logfire]'
```

2. Authentication:
```bash
# Using pip
logfire auth

# Using uv
uv run logfire auth
```

3. Project Configuration:
```bash
# Using pip
logfire projects new

# Using uv
uv run logfire projects new
```

4. Code Integration:
```python
import logfire
logfire.configure()
```
